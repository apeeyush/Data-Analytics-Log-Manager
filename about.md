Data Analytics Log Manager helps collect log data and provides tools to analyze this data.

It provides a lot of flexibility on the type of log data. A single log entry can contain multiple arbitrary key value pairs (Let's say `"application" => "Test App"`, `"event" => "Clicked on Wiki"` and so on). The analytics tools are powerful as well as easy to use. We aim to make complex analytics easy for not only programmers but also other users such as researchers, managers, designers etc. who may not have prior exposure to programming.

The application is being developed for data analytics under educational settings but it caters to a much wider audience. You may find it really useful if you have an application for which you would like to collect logs and visualize how your users are using it.

The application started as a [Google Summer of Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) project.
